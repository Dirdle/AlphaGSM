This is the Sector Alpha Game Server Manager.

This tool runs game servers using screen to manage the sessions and provides
tools to control them in a consistent way and to possibly many servers at once.
This also contains code to share downloads and if possible the actual files
between multiple installs.

For changing users sudo is used so all protected permissions are controlled
using sudo.

The public script is alphagsm which should be installed in bin/ using a symlink
(It can't be physically moved as other paths are resolved relative to it's true
location). For help using it run alphagsm --help. For help editing and
contributing see the documentation in the source code or the pydoc output.

The plans are also being discussed on the sector alpha wiki at
http://wiki.sector-alpha.net/index.php?title=AlphaGSM
