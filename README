so this will be the place for the server manager code.

it will

1) boot servers
2) shutdown servers
3) check their status
4) game servers for all (sasha user account holders)

The plans are being discussed on the sector alpha wiki at http://wiki.sector-alpha.net/index.php?title=Game_Server_Management_Tool
