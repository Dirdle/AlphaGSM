This is the Sector Alpha Game Server Manager.

This tool runs game servers using screen to manage the sessions and provides
tools to control them in a consistent way and to possibly many servers at once.
This also contains code to share downloads and if possible the actual files
between multiple installs.

For changing users sudo is used so all protected permissions are controlled
using sudo.

The public script is alphagsm which should be installed in bin/ using a symlink
(It can't be physically moved as other paths are resolved relative to it's true
location). For help using it run alphagsm --help. For help editing and
contributing see the documentation in the source code or the pydoc output.

The plans are also being discussed on the sector alpha wiki at
http://wiki.sector-alpha.net/index.php?title=AlphaGSM

Screen

python3-crontab

Example setup of a minecraft vanilla server

alphagsm mymcserver create minecraft
alphagsm mymcserver setup
alphagsm mymcserver start

Setup will prompt you to choose your server version, your installation location, your port and whether to accept the EULA. Setup will vary from game server to game server

Additionally, alphagsm mymcserver create minecraft will default to minecraft.vanilla. You can install e.g tekkit via minecraft.tekkit.

For additional features, additional command arguments, you can call ./alphagsm --help 

to stop the server

alphagsm mymcserver stop

to backup

alphagsm mymcserver backup

At the moment, this code only supports minecraft, there are immediate plans to support other game servers (Terraria, steam games) in the near future.

you can also symlink alphagsm to any directory you wish, or move it to /usr/bin/ to run alphagsm anywhere on your system
